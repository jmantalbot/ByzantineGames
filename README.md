# Meeting 1 
11/19/2025

All members attended this meeting.

## Project Code Planning

All code will be written in terms of functions and calling those functions, no classes needed... yet.

Discussion over how to organize simulation and implement scenario 1.

Agent strategies: Deterministic, Greedy, Random, Safe, Water_Fill

Adversary strategies: Random, Deterministic, Expected Value.

### Scenarios

Scenario 1: n = 4, t = 1, l = 1
Scenario 2: n = 10, t = 3, l = 3
Scenario 3: n = 10, t = 2, l = 5

Values for boxes have been established for Scenario 1. Start there and then see about the best values for future scenarios.

Nathan can get a framework up by tonight for everyone to look at.
